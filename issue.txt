I love the idea of this project and find it very useful.   I had to work around an error when executing this module.  

node:internal/modules/typescript:183
    throw new ERR_UNSUPPORTED_NODE_MODULES_TYPE_STRIPPING(filename);
          ^

Error [ERR_UNSUPPORTED_NODE_MODULES_TYPE_STRIPPING]: Stripping types is currently unsupported for files under node_modules, for "<redacted>\node_modules\express-api-to-postman\routeExtractor.ts"

I am using Node v24.12.0 and this command:  `express-api-to-postman ./dist/server.js backend-api`
It appears Node 24 does not yet support TS files within node_modules.  

I tried a few things and managed to get the module executing by manually updating the  `src/cli.js` file to import statement to `import { extractRoutesFromServer } from "../dist/routeExtractor.js";`
